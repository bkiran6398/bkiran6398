## 🧠 About Me

I'm a seasoned backend engineer with deep expertise in **Go**, **Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)**, and distributed systems. I've consistently delivered performant, scalable, and secure backend solutions—often from scratch—and played critical roles in designing architecture, implementing complex workflows, and optimizing high-throughput systems.

With a passion for clean code, system design, and new-age tech like **IoT**, **FinTech**, and **Blockchain**, I'm always looking to build systems that solve real-world problems with precision and efficiency.
